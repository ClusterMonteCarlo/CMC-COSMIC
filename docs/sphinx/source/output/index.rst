Here we list all of the output files that are generated in a typical CMC run, 
and offer some suggestsions on how to analyze them.  Generally, the output 
comes in one of two types: `log files`, where individual events (e.g. stellar 
collisions, mergers, fewbody interactions) are logged whenenver they happen or 
when specific quantities are recorded every timestep (e.g. the number of black 
holes, the core radius, the lagrange radii), and `snapshots`, where the state 
of every star and binary in the cluster is recorded.  These are saved in plain 
text dat files and hdf5 files, respectively.

Most of the log files are in plain text (.dat) with easily readable columns 
that can be loaded in python with either ``loadtxt`` or the appropriate pandas 
commands.  However, a handful of the event log files, such as the binary 
interaction (binint.log), collision (collision.log), and stellar evolution 
distruption (semergedistrupt.log), are somewhat more difficult to parse.  We 
have provided a python package to make parsing these easier; it is located in 
the ``CMC-COSMIC/tools`` directory of the main CMC folder (the `cmc_parser.py 
<https://github.com/ClusterMonteCarlo/CMC-COSMIC/tree/master/tools>`_ file).

.. _cmcparser:

The log files can be imported using (specifying only the prefix that you provided for the output when running CMC):

.. ipython:: python

        import cmc_parser as cp
        units,binints,semergers,collisions = cp.load_ineraction_files('source/example_output/output')


We will discuss each of these below.

The HDF5 snapshots are designed to be importable as Pandas tables and are 
described below.  These snapshots can also be converted into various 
observational quantities, such as surface brightness profiles, velocity 
dispersion profiles, and more, using the `cmctoolkit` package (`Rui et al., 
2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210305033R/abstract>`_).  We 
include the python code from the main package in the ``CMC-COSMIC/tools`` 
folder, but please see `here <https://github.com/NicholasRui/cmctoolkit>`_ for 
complete instructions and useage.

.. note::

        Here we are using the output from the :ref:`realistic-initial-conditions` example, running it for 15 Myr (though note that the default ini file runs it for 13.8 Gyr) and having it print a window snapshot every 10 Myr.  On 28 cores of the Vera machine, this takes about 10 minutes.  

==========
Code Units
==========

CMC uses the standard N-body units `(HÃ©non 1971a) 
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00649159>`_ in all numerical 
calculations: the gravitational constant :math:`{G=1}`, the initial total mass 
:math:`{M=1}`, and the initial total energy :math:`{E_0=-1/4}`. The conversion 
from code units to physical units for time is done by calculating the initial 
half-mass relaxation time in years. The file ``<output>.conv.sh`` contains all 
conversion factors used to convert from code to physical units. For example, to 
convert from code units of time to Myr, multiply by the factor timeunitsmyr, 
and so on. **Unless otherwise noted, all values below are in code units.** 

This file can be parsed using the above command, or using a stand-alone command for only the conversion dictionary:

.. ipython:: python

        import cmc_parser as cp
        conv_file = cp.conversion_file('source/example_output/output.conv.sh')
        print(conv_file.mass_msun)
        print(conv_file.__dict__)

==========
Log Files
==========

Listed below are the output files of CMC with the variables printed out. Unless 
explicitly stated, variables are in `code units`. 

output.dyn.dat
---------------

The **output.dyn.dat** files contains various theoretical quantities pertaining 
to the dynamical evolution of your cluster, such as theoretical core radius, 
total mass, central density, central velocity dispersion, etc. This file may be 
used to create, for example, plots of core radii or half-mass radii versus time 
for a given simulation. Be warned that these theoretical quantities are not 
necessarily the same as the way observers would define these quantities. 
However, these quantities are all useful for establishing a general idea of how 
the cluster evolves.

output.binint.log
------------------

Over the course of the evolution of the cluster, single stars and binaries will 
frequently undergo three- and four-body dynamical encounters, which are 
integrated directly in CMC using the Fewbody package (Fregeau et al. 2007). The 
file **output.binint.log** records all input and output parameters (e.g., 
component masses, IDS, stellar types, semi-major axes, etc.) each type fewbody 
is called. 

Every encounter information is printed between two lines of asterisks.
Below is an exemplary output:

==============================  =====================================================

Objects are labelled starting from 0 to 3. The binary-single and binary-binary 
encounters are denoted as BS and BB, respectively. For type=binary, indices 0 
and 1 in mass, radius,id,etc. denote the primary and secondary objects in a 
binary.

Possible outcomes for ``type=BS``:

* single-binary 0 [1 2]
* binary-single [2 0] 1
* single-single-single 0 1 2
* single-single 0:1 2
* binary [0:1 2]
* single 0:1:2

Possible outcomes for ``type=BB``: 

* binary [0 1:2:3]
* single-binary 0:1 [2 3]
* binary-single [0:1 3] 2
* binary-binary [0 1] [2 3] 
* single-triple 0 [[1 3] 2]
* triple-single [[0 1] 3] 2
* single-single-binary 3 1 [2 0]
* binary-single-single [0 1] 3 2
* single-binary-single 0 [1 3] 2

0:1 denotes the fact that objects 0 and 1 have merged, and [0 1] indicates that 
objects 0 and 1 have formed a binary. The same is true for any pairs from 0 to 
3.

While the `binint` file is easy to read, it can be difficult to parse.  Using 
the ``load_interaction_files`` command from :ref:`above <cmcparser>` provides 
the ``binints`` object, a python list of dictionaries of every encounter:

.. ipython:: python

        print(binints[0].__dict__)

        # input binaries is a list that can be printed with:
        print(binints[0].in_binaries[0].__dict__)

        # and the individual stars of that binary can be accessed with:
        print(binints[0].in_binaries[0].star1.__dict__)

        # so if I wanted, for instance, the radius of star two of the input binary in the first encounter:
        print(binints[0].in_binaries[0].star2.r_RSUN)

        # If I wanted to know the escape speed of the cluster where this encouner occured, I can access that with
        print(binints[0].vesc_KMS)

output.bh.dat
-------------

This file contains the number of BHs (as well as BH binaries, etc.) at each 
dynamical time step. This is useful to plot, for example, the number of 
retained BHs versus time. For BH mergers, you want to look in 
**output.bhmerger.dat**, which records all BH-BH mergers that occur inside the 
cluster during the cluster evolution.

output.bh.esc.dat
----------------
This file contains the number of ejected BHs at each dynamical time step. It 
includes the same columns in the **initial.bh.dat** file.

output.bhmerger.dat
---------------------

List of all binary black hole mergers that occur in the cluster (note this does 
not include BBHs that may be ejected from the cluster and merge later).  There 
are four categories of mergers that occur inside the cluster:

 * **isolat-binary** - merger that occurs in a binary, but not due to GW capture
 * **binary-single** - merger that occurs due to GW capture during a binary-single encounter
 * **binary-binary** - merger that occurs due to GW capture during a binary-binary encounter
 * **single-single** - merger that occurs due to GW capture between two isoalted black holes

``e_500M``                      "
==============================  =====================================================

 .. DANGER::

        The ``a_final`` and ``e_final`` parameters change depending on the type of encounter.  For binary-single and binary-binary GW captures, these record the 
        (Newtonian) semi-major axis and eccentricity at 10M (when we consider the BHs to have mergred.  However, this is an unreliable quantity, since the orbit 
        is decidedly non-Newtonian at that point.  If you want eccentricities, use ``a_100M`` and ``e_100M``, or preferably the outermost value above).

        For single-single GW captures, ``a_final`` and ``e_final`` are the semi-major axis and eccentricity that the GW capture formed at.  For isolat-binary 
        mergers, it's the last semi-major axis and eccentricity that were recorded in the cluster.


output.collision.log

This file lists stellar types and properties for all stellar collisions 
occurring in the given simulation. See Sections 6 and 7 of Kremer et al. 2019 
for further detail.

``coll_mult``                    Collison multiplyer e.g., sticky sphere (``coll_mul`` = 1), TDE (``coll_mul``> 1)
==============================  =====================================================


The single-single, binary-single, etc indicate whether the collision occurred 
during a binary encounter or not. When there are three stars listed for the 
collision it means that all three stars collided during the encounter. This is 
rare, but it does happen occasionally. Typically, one will see something like:

.. code-block:: bash 

      t=0.00266079 binary-single idm=717258(mm=1.0954) id1=286760(m1=0.669391):id2=415309 (m2=0.426012) (r=0.370419) typem=1 type1=0 type2=0

In this case the colliding stars are m1=0.66 and m2=0.42. The information about 
the third star in this binary--single encounter is not stored in the 
collision.log file. The only way to get information about the third star is to 
find this binary-single encounter in the **output.binint.log** file (can be 
identified easily using the encounter time (here t=0.00266) and also 
cross-checking the id numbers for the two stars listed in the collision file).

Similarly to the binint file, the collision file can be processed using the :ref:`load_interaction_file <cmcparser>` command

.. ipython:: python

        print(collisions[0].__dict__)


output.semergedisrupt.log
--------------------------

This file lists all stellar mergers that occur through binary evolution in each simulation. 

==============================  =====================================================

``id1(r1)``					         ID_1 (mass of body_1)
``id2(m2)``					 	      ID_2 (mass of body_2)

.. ipython:: python

        print(semergers[0].__dict__)

.. _escfile:

output.esc.dat
---------------

As the result of dynamical encounters (and other mechanisms such as cluster 
tidal truncation) single stars and binaries often become unbound from the 
cluster potential and are ejected from the system. When this happens, the 
ejection is recorded in **output.esc.dat**. In particular, this ejection 
process plays an intimate role in the formation of merging BH binaries. If a 
BH-BH binary is ejected from the cluster with sufficiently small orbital 
separation it may merge within a Hubble time and be a possible LIGO source. To 
determine the number of such mergers, calculate the inspiral times for all 
BH-BH binaries that appear in the **output.esc.dat** file.


Parameters with a `_0` (i.e., mass, radius, star type, etc) correspond to the 
primary star in a binary. There is also the same column for the secondary star 
with `_0` replaced by `_1` in the **output.esc.dat** file. Parameters without 
indicies indicate single stars.  the orbital parameters

The Lagrange radii are the radii enclosing a given percentage of the cluster's 
total mass. So for example, the 10% lagrange radii printed in the 
**output.lagrad.dat** file is the radius at a given time that encloses 10% of 
the mass.Â The different columns in that file give 0.1%, 5%, 99%, etc. lagrange 
radii.

==========
Snapshots
==========
.. note::

        See :ref:`here <snapshotting>` for how to set the various snapshot parameters in the ini file
        
There are three different kinds of snapshots that CMC saves:

 * **output.snapshot.h5** -- every star and binary, saved every ``SNAPSHOT_DELTACOUNT`` number of code timesteps
 * **output.window.snapshot.h5** -- every star and binary, saved in uniform physical timesteps (set in ``SNAPSHOT_WINDOWS``)
 * **output.bhsnapshot.h5** -- same as output.shapshot.h5, but just for black holes 

Each snapshot is saved as a table in the respective hdf5 file.  To see the 
names of the snapshots, use ``h5ls``:

.. code-block:: bash

        h5ls output.window.snapshot.h5

On the window snapshots from our test example, this shows two snapshots

.. code-block:: bash

        0(t=0Gyr)                Dataset {100009/Inf}
        1(t=0.010001767Gyr)      Dataset {99233/Inf}

For the windows, this shows the number of the snapshot, and the time that the 
snapshot was made (in whatever units the window is using).  For the other 
snapshots, the time is the time in code units.

The snapshots themselves are designed to be imported as pandas tables, which 
each table name referring to a key in the hdf5 file.  To read in the snapshot 
at 10Myr:

.. ipython:: python

        import pandas as pd 
        snap = pd.read_hdf('source/example_output/output.window.snapshots.h5',key='1(t=0.010001767Gyr)')
        print(snap)

This contains all the necessary information about the state of every star and 
binary at this given time.  We can also see the column names

.. ipython:: python

        print(snap.columns) 

You may notice, however, that these columns are exactly the same as those in 
the :ref:`output.esc.dat <escfile>`  file!

The following are the columns in the snapshots but not in the escape file.

==============================  =====================================================
``luminosity``                  Luminosity of isolated stars [LSUN]
``radius``                      Radius of isolated stars [RSUN]
``bin_star_lum0``               Same as lum0
``bin_star_lum1``               Same as lum1
``bin_star_radius0``            [RSUN]
``bin_star_radius1``            [RSUN]
``bin_Eb``                      Binary binding energy
``eta``                         Binary hardness
``star.phi``                    Potential at the star's position r
==============================  =====================================================

====================
Cluster Observables
====================

The `cmctoolkit <https://github.com/NicholasRui/cmctoolkit>`_ is a seperate 
python package specifically designed to analyze CMC snapshots.  It then 
computes many of the relevant astrophysical profiles of interest to observers 
(e.g. surface brightness profiles, number density profiles, velocity 
dispersions, mass-to-light ratios) allowing CMC to be directly compared to 
globular clusters and super star clusters in the local universe.  This is 
accomplished by a rigorous statistical averaging of the individual cluster 
orbits for each star; see `Rui et al., (2021) 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210305033R/abstract>`_ for details.

By default, the cmctoolkit will import the last snapshot in an hdf5 snapshot file:

.. ipython:: python

        import cmctoolkit as cmct
        last_snap = cmct.Snapshot(fname='source/example_output/output.window.snapshots.h5',
                                  conv='source/example_output/output.conv.sh',
                                  dist=15, # distance to cluster in kpc
                                  z=0.0017) # metallicity 
                                 

But any snapshot in the file can be loaded by specifying the hdf5 key:

.. ipython:: python

        import cmctoolkit as cmct
        first_snap = cmct.Snapshot(fname='source/example_output/output.window.snapshots.h5',
                                  conv='source/example_output/output.conv.sh',
                                  snapshot_name='0(t=0Gyr)',
                                  dist=15, # distance to cluster in kpc
                                  z=0.0017) # metallicity
                                

As an example of what the `cmctoolkit` can do, we can create U-band surface 
brightness profiles for both snapshots, seeing they change due to the combined 
effects of stellar evolution and the early expansion of the cluster due to mass 
loss:

.. ipython:: python

        first_snap.add_photometry('source/output/filt_index.txt');

        u_bincenter_first, u_profile_first = first_snap.make_smoothed_brightness_profile('U', bins=80,
                                                                       min_mass=None, max_mass=None,
                                                                       max_lum=None, fluxdict=None,
                                                                       startypes=np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
                                                                       min_logr=-1.5)

        last_snap.add_photometry('source/output/filt_index.txt');

        u_bincenter_last, u_profile_last = last_snap.make_smoothed_brightness_profile('U', bins=80,
                                                                       min_mass=None, max_mass=None,
                                                                       max_lum=None, fluxdict=None,
                                                                       startypes=np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
                                                                       min_logr=-1.5)
        plt.plot(u_bincenter_first, u_profile_first, lw=2, label='0 Myr');
        plt.plot(u_bincenter_last, u_profile_last, lw=2, label='10 Myr');
