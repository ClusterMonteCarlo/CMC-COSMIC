Configuration files for CMC
###########################

The `cmc` command-line executable cannot run without a configuration file.  These ini files are designed to contain all the stellar evolution physics to generate a COSMIC population (i.e. the initial conditions for CMC) and all the dynamical options.  Note that there are two distinct modes you might want to run CMC in: either as a purely dynamics code, with no real stars or stellar evolution, or with all the bells and whistles, to produce realistic models of clusters.  These are sufficiently different that we have included two ini files in the examples directory:

    **KingProfile.ini** is designed to run a cluster with most of the available physics.  Use this for realistic star cluster simulations (it is what is described as "default" below).  The ini file can be found  `Here <https://github.com/ClusterMonteCarlo/CMC-COSMIC/blob/master/examples/KingProfile.ini>`_

    **PlummerSphere.ini** is designed to run a cluster with pure dynamics; no stars or stellar evolution, and will halt once the cluster reaches core collapse.  Use this for classical dynamics studies and learning the code.  The ini file can be found  `Here <https://github.com/ClusterMonteCarlo/CMC-COSMIC/blob/master/examples/PlummerSphere.ini>`_


.. warning::

    The parameter names are case insensitive, and we've tried to include everything currently used in the code here.  If you forget one, CMC will substitute a default value.  However, note that there are several default values still in the code that are NOT described here.  These are largely from either deprecated features, or parts of the code that are not working yet in the parallel version.  If they work at all, we would strongly advise against using them for any type of production run.  


[cmc]
=====


Although this is all one section, we have grouped the flags/parameters which get passed to the dynamics and binary stellar evolution codes into (rough) categories. Each group will start with a note to indicate. the type of parameter or flag.

COMMON ENVELOPE FLAGS
---------------------

**Note:** there are cases where a common envelope is forced regardless of the
critical mass ratio for unstable mass transfer. In the following cases, a
common envelope occurs regardless of the choices below:

**contact** : the stellar radii go into contact (common for similar ZAMS systems)

**periapse contact** : the periapse distance is smaller than either of the stellar radii (common for highly eccentric systems)

**core Roche overflow** : either of the stellar radii overflow their component's Roche radius (in this case, mass transfer from the convective core is always dynamically unstable)

=======================  =====================================================
``alpha1``               Common-envelope efficiency parameter which scales the
                         efficiency of transferring orbital energy to the
                         envelope. See `Equation 71 in Hurley+2002 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2002MNRAS.329..897H&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST&high=#page=11>`_.

                         The initial binding energy of the stellar envelope
                         goes like 1 / :math:`{\lambda}`. See `Equation 69 in Hurley+2002 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2002MNRAS.329..897H&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST&high=#page=11>`_.

                            in appendix of `Claeys+2014 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563A..83C/abstract>`_
                            where lambdaf is the fraction of the ionization energy that can go into ejecting
                            the envelope; to use this prescription without extra ionization energy, set lambdaf=0

                            ``negative values`` : fixes :math:`{\lambda}` to a value of -1.0* *lambdaf*

                         **lambdaf = 0.0**

``ceflag``               Selects the `de Kool 1990 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...358..189D/abstract>`_
                         model to set the initial orbital energy using the
                         total mass of the stars instead of the core masses as
                         in `Equation 70 of Hurley+2002 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.329..897H/abstract>`_.

                            ``0`` : Uses the core mass to calculate initial
                            orbital energy as

``cekickflag``           Selects which mass and separation values to use when
                         a supernova occurs during the CE and a kick
                         needs to be applied.

                            ``0`` : uses pre-CE mass and post-CE sep (BSE default)

                            ``1`` : uses pre-CE mass and sep values

                            ``2`` : uses post-CE mass and sep

                         **cekickflag = 2**

``cemergeflag``          Determines whether stars that begin a CE
                         without a core-envelope boundary automatically lead to
                         merger in CE. These systems include:
                         kstars = [0,1,2,7,8,10,11,12].

                            ``0`` : allows the CE to proceed

                            ``1`` : causes these systems to merge in the CE

                         **cemergeflag = 0**

``cehestarflag``         Uses fitting formulae from `Tauris+2015 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.451.2123T/abstract>`_
                         for evolving RLO systems with a helium star donor
                         and compact object accretor.
                         NOTE: this flag will override choice made by
                         cekickflag if set

                            ``0`` : does NOT use Tauris+2015 at all

                            ``1`` : uses Tauris+2015 fits for final period only

                            ``2`` : uses Tauris+2015 fits for both final mass and final period

                         **cehestarflag = 0**

                         during RLO.
                         NOTE: this is overridden by qcrit_array if any of the

                         Eq.1: ``qc = 0.362 + 1.0/(3.0*(1.0 - massc(j1)/mass(j1)))``, which is from Hjellming & Webbink 1983

                         Eq.2: ``qc = (1.67d0-zpars(7)+2.d0*(massc(j1)/mass(j1))**5)/2.13d0``, which is from Claeys+ 2014

``qcrit_array``          Array with length: 16 for user-input values for the
                         critical mass ratios that govern the onset of unstable
                         mass transfer and a common envelope. Each item is set
                         individually for its associated kstar, and a value of
                         0.0 will apply prescription of the qcflag for that kstar.

                         **Note:** there are cases where a common envelope is forced
                         regardless of the critical mass ratio for unstable mass
                         transfer; in the following cases, a common envelope occurs
                         regardless of the qcrit or qcflag

``bhspinmag``            Sets either the spin of all BHs or the upper limit of the uniform distribution for BH spins

                            ``values >= 0.0`` : spin or upper limit value
