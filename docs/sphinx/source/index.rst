=================================
The Cluster Monte Carlo Code, CMC
=================================
Welcome to the documentation for CMC, an `N`-body code for collisional stellar 
dynamics based on the original method of `HÃ©non (1971) 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971Ap%26SS..14..151H/abstract>`_.  CMC has 
been under development for more than 20 years, starting with `Joshi et al. (2000 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...540..969J/abstract>`_, `2001) 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...550..691J/abstract>`_, `Fregeau et 
al. (2003) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...593..772F/abstract>`_.  
It has been upgraded to include all the relevant physics for modeling dense 
spherical star clusters, such as strong dynamical encounters (`Fregeau & Rasio 
2007 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...658.1047F/abstract>`_), single 
and binary stellar evoltuion (`Chatterjee et al. 2010 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...719..915C/abstract>`_), central 
massive black holes (`Umbreit et al. 2012 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...750...31U/abstract>`_), three-body 
binary formation (`Morscher et al., 2014 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...763L..15M/abstract>`_), 
relativistic dynamics (`Rodriguez et al. 2018 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvL.120o1101R/abstract>`_) and more.  
CMC is parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), allowing it to 
run on workstations and distributed-memory high-performance computing clusters 
(`Pattabiraman et al. 2013 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..204...15P/abstract>`_). It has been 
shown to produce similar results to state-of-the-art direct `N`-body simulations 
(`Rodriguez et al. 2016 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.463.2109R/abstract>`_).

The public version of CMC is pinned to the `COSMIC 
<https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/>`_ package for binary population synthesis 
(`Breivik et al. 2019 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898...71B/abstract>`_), which 
itself was originally based on the version of BSE (`Hurley et al. 2002 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.329..897H/abstract>`_) that was 
developed in CMC over many years (`Chatterjee et al. 2010 
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...719..915C/abstract>`_, `Rodriguez 
et al. 2016 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvD..93h4029R/abstract>`_, 
and `2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhRvL.120o1101R/abstract>`_).  
Both projects have advanced significantly since then, but are pinned at the 
repository level: COSMIC is currently a submodule within CMC, ensuring that any 
cluster simulations or binary populations are integrated with the same physics.
