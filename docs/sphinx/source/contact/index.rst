===================
Open a GitHub Issue
===================

The easiest way to ask a question or notify us of any bugs is to post an issue on GitHub, in the `issue page <https://github.com/ClusterMonteCarlo/CMC-COSMIC/issues>`_ of the repository.  This is particularly helpful for code related bugs or other issues.  The more information you can provide when you open an issue, the more likely we can be helpful.l

For issues with the initial conditions, open an issue on the COSMIC GitHub account `here <https://github.com/COSMIC-PopSynth/COSMIC/issues>`_

===================
Contact us Directly
===================

We'll be setting up either a mailing list or slack channel if there is sufficient interest from the community.  For now, you can email `Carl Rodriguez <mailto:carlrodriguez@cmu.edu>`_.
