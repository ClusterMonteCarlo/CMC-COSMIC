# The input file is where you specify all the necessary parameters to run the 
# code.  It uses the format "keyword value", with the following syntax allowed:
# "KEYWORD value", "KEYWORD = value", "keyword value", or "keyword = value".
# In other words, whitespace is equivalent to an equal sign, and the case of
# the keyword doesn't matter.  Also, only one keyword-value pair is allowed per
# line.
