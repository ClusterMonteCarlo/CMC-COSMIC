# The input file is where you specify all the necessary parameters to run the 
# code.  It uses the format "keyword value", with the following syntax allowed:
# "KEYWORD value", "KEYWORD = value", "keyword value", or "keyword = value".
# In other words, whitespace is equivalent to an equal sign, and the case of
# the keyword doesn't matter.  Also, only one keyword-value pair is allowed per
# line.
# The values used here are for a pure relaxation, equal-mass plummer model. 
#
# No longer used.

### physics ### 
#GAMMA times the number of stars (N0) is the Coulomb logarithm.
#The relaxation time can be written as U_trel= N0/ln(N0*GAMMA)* U_t with U_t
#as the crossing time. Thus, for a given cluster, GAMMA is needed to transform
#the code units (U_trel) into physical units.
GAMMA = 0.11
#The number of inner stars to calculate core properties. This variable will be
#slowly phased out, as the underlying method to calculate core properties that
#uses this variable is outdated (unsuitable).

# Perturb stars? This parameter determines whether we should include any form
# of perturbation, like two-body relaxation and binary interactions.

# This switch turns 2-body relaxation on, but is only effective if PERTURB=1
RELAXATION = 1
# THETASEMAX is a measure of the time step. It represents the maximum
# effective deflection angle of a two-body encounter. For each two-body
# encounter the time intervall is caluclated after which the bodies are
# deflected by this angle and the smallest of these intervals is chosen as an
# estimate of the relaxation time step.
THETASEMAX = 1
# The following parameter should always be set to zero as subzoning (whatever
# it is ...) causes a significant loss of energy.
