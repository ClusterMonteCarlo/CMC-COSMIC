The use of sub timesteps contributes to very large energy errors (see the
figure in this directory).  With sub timesteps turned on, for an N=10^5 
Plummer model with no binaries (actually, just one binary for reasons of 
convenience), the relative energy error up to the point of core collapse is 
~15%.  With sub timesteps turned off in the exact same code, the relative 
energy error is ~5%.  This has been verified by using an original version of 
the cluster code that was written before Kris put in sub timesteps.

To my knowledge, the origin of the energy error has not yet been found.
However, it could simply be spurious relaxation (caused by fluctuations of
the core potential), which would be more prevalent in the sub timestep
implementation because more core timesteps are taken.
