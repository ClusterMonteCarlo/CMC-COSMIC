	* fewbody.h: Version bump to 0.21 (Bender).  This is mainly a bug
	  fix release, with no changes in the interface from the previous
	  version (0.20).  The bugs fixed do not change the physics.
	  However, the stability test for [[* *] [* *]] quadruples has
	  changed and is now the Mardling & Aarseth (2001) test, from
	  section 4.2 of their paper.

	* fewbody_hier.c: Changed from malloc() to calloc() in
	  fb_malloc_hier() to get rid of harmless Valgrind errors due to
	  normalizing uninitialized memory.
