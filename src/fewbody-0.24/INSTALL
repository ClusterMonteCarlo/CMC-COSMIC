You will need to have the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) installed before
compiling Fewbody.  If you are running GNU/Linux, it's possible that you
already have GSL installed on your machine, since it comes with many
distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake, Gentoo, etc.

If you don't have GSL installed, take a look at
http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/ to learn how to download and install it.  
If you are running an RPM-based GNU/Linux distribution, check out
rpmfind.net and search for "gsl" and "gsl-devel".  Hopefully there will be
RPMs there for your distribution.  If you are running Debian GNU/Linux,
just do "apt-get install libgsl0 libgsl0-dev" (for Debian 3.0).  If you
are running Mac OSX, please see the file "INSTALL.osx".

Once you have GSL installed, extract Fewbody with "tar xvzf
fewbody-[version].tar.gz".  cd into the Fewbody directory with "cd
fewbody-[version]".  Then type "make" to build it.  This will create
several Fewbody executables (such as binsingle, binbin, and cluster), as
well as object files that can be linked into other programs.  Type "make
install" to install the executables into $HOME/bin.  You can change the
installation location by editing the PREFIX variable near the top of the
Makefile.  Type "uninstall" to remove the executables from the
installation directory.

The following executables will be installed:

	binsingle	binary-single scattering
	binbin		binary-binary scattering
	triplebin	triple-binary scattering
	cluster		Plummer model cluster

To get detailed instructions on each utility, use the "-h" (or "--help")  
flag.
