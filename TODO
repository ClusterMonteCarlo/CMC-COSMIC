* Fix massive energy loss visible when relaxation is turned off.  
  Something is wrong with either the calculation of the potential, or 
  get_positions().
* *sigh*: The first Lagrange radius is lost when reading in from the input
  file.  This needs to be fixed.
* Decouple the potential from the star structure.  They are physically
  different things, and the fact that they're tied together has caused
  significant problems already.  We just need a quickly searchable array
  containing (radius, potential) pairs.
* Make units more persistent in code, and accessible by everyone.
* Set criterion for stopping calculation based on tstop in code and physical
  units.
* Create much better system for setting physical units in the input file.
  Perhaps it should be that the input FITS files are minimal representations
  of N-body systems, in N-body units, and everything else is set in the input
  file?  No, this fails when binaries are added to the input FITS file.
  Physical units are a necessary part of this file once all scales are (over-)
  specified.  Need utilities for modifying properties of input FITS files:
  fits_add_binaries, fits_set_scales, etc.
* For runaways, include not only "standard" stellar evolution, but also pre-
  main sequence evolution?  This is relevant for stars less massive than ~2-3
  M_o, whose radii can be several times larger than their MS values for times 
  longer than ~3 Myr (Freitag, et al. 2005).
* Update FITS code to reflect deleted/added input file parameters, etc.
* Rewrite get_positions().  Can solve dQ/dr=0 to get r at v_r,max, which can be
  used to bisect the r interval into two portions, each containing a root of
  Q(r)=0.  This is what the force_t variable type is for.
