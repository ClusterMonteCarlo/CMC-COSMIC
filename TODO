*** things that _have_ to be done, in order of priority ***
***********************************************************

* Add fixed radius option to setstellar.c.
* Make default output names of utilities more descriptive,
  like input_to_setimf.fits, input_to_setstellar.fits.
* Fix stellar rejuvenation in cmc_dynamics_helper.c, and implement
  collision matrix for different stellar types.
* Add GPU-accelerated CUDA code for get_positions()/FindZero_Q().
* Parallelize fewbody interactions again?

* Resurrect binary interaction logging.
* Keep triples?  This should be easier to do now that the dynamical
  interaction part of the code has been generalized.
* Perhaps automate writing of snapshotting routines?  This could be done with,
  e.g., a Perl script that catalogs all global variables, then writes the 
  routines to dump them to a FITS file.
* Decouple the potential from the star structure.  They are physically
  different things, and the fact that they're tied together has caused
  significant problems already.  We just need a quickly searchable array
  containing (radius, potential) pairs.
* Set criterion for stopping calculation based on tstop in code and physical
  units.
* Rewrite get_positions().  Can solve dQ/dr=0 to get r at v_r,max, which can be
  used to bisect the r interval into two portions, each containing a root of
  Q(r)=0.  This is what the force_t variable type is for.
