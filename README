To install the ClusterMonteCarlo (CMC) code Autoconf later than 2.59 is
required. Simply run 

autoreconf -ivf

which produces a configure script.  The code can then be installed like any
other Autotools project, as described in INSTALL. The default installation path
is in the users home directory. There are some extra configure options that one
might want to use:

--enable-cuda   enable GPU acceleration for nVidia cards using CUDA C

This option requires the nVidia CUDA toolkit to be installed and nvcc to be in
your PATH.

--enable-static-linking         links all external libraries statically

It is automatically disabled when --enable-cuda is set, as the CUDA runtime
library only exists as a shared library.

--enable-experimental   Use a more accurate (but slower) orbit calculation
                        routine.

This is only necessary for runs with IMBH.

--with-gcc-arch         use architecture <arch> for gcc -march/-mtune,
                        instead of guessing.

The AX_CC_MAX_OPT macro does not recognize the newer Xeon (iCore7 family)
processors, which are, e.g., installed on Quest, so you can set the
corresponding architecture flag with this option.  For newer gcc versions you
can set this flag to native and gcc will detect the architecture of the machine
it is running on itself.
