	* fewbody.h: Updated version.  This is a bug fix release.  The only
	  change relative to the previous version is a fix in
	  sigma_binsingle.c for the calculation of the cross section for
	  k=10 (all stars colliding and merging into one star).

	* INSTALL.osx: Updated.

2005-09-07 14:32  fregeau

	* sigma_binsingle.c: Fixed typo in sigma_binsingle.c that prevented
	  the counting of triple collision events.

	* fewbody.h: Version bump to 0.22 (Oooo).  This version has a
	  corrected technique for for calculating tides, which is used in
	  collapsing/expanding binaries, and beginning numerical
	  integration.	The results should be only minimally affected for
	  comparable-mass systems, but may change dramatically for large
	  mass ratio systems.  This version also now determines whether or
	  not an interaction was resonant.  This information is return in
	  the fb_ret_t structure in the member Nosc.  If Nosc >= 1 then the
	  interaction was resonant.  If Nosc=0 it was not resonant.
	  Finally, this version now includes a (currently experimental)
	  function for automatically calculating binary-single cross
	  sections.  It has been tested for a few simple cases and appears
	  to yield sensible results.  I haven't yet carefully checked my
	  handling of the statistics, which uses a novel technique that is
	  really a generalization of Steve McMillan's technique for
	  automatic cross section calculation.	Enjoy.

	* scripts/release.sh: Updated for new environment.

2005-06-10 10:33  fregeau

	* fewbody.h: Updated version.

2004-11-30 15:39  fregeau

	* sigma_binsingle.c: Made it quieter.  It still needs some cleaning
	  up.

2004-11-26 18:28  fregeau

	* fewbody.h, sigma_binsingle.c, sigma_binsingle.h: The new
	  automatic sigma calculator seems to be working...

2004-11-24 16:10  fregeau

	* sigma_binsingle.c: Progress...

2004-11-22 23:29  fregeau

	* sigma_binsingle.c: Still working on it...

2004-11-22 20:16  fregeau

	* sigma_binsingle.c, sigma_binsingle.h: Just need to sync so I can
	  work from home...

2004-11-21 12:06  fregeau

	* Makefile, sigma_binsingle.c, sigma_binsingle.h: New routine for
	  automatic calculation of cross sections.

2004-11-19 14:30  fregeau

	* Makefile, Makefile.osx: Makefile now checks for ccache and uses
	  if available.  Also, the two main architectures (Linux and Mac OS
	  X) have been merged into the same Makefile.

2004-11-19 13:01  fregeau

	* binbin.c, binsingle.c, fewbody_utils.c, triplebin.c: Fixed
	  treatment of tides for disparate mass ratios.

2004-11-15 15:55  fregeau

	* fewbody.h: Version pre-bump.

2004-11-15 15:43  fregeau

	* binbin.c, binsingle.c, cluster.c, fewbody.c, fewbody.h,
	  triplebin.c: Improved algorithm for detecting oscillations in s^2
	  by updating s2minprev only if a valid oscillation has been found.
	  This works because many invalid oscillations occur near the
	  semi-local maxima (due to binary motion), but no invalid
	  oscillations occur near the semi-local minima (since the close
	  approach happens so quickly).

2004-11-15 14:23  fregeau

	* fewbody.c, fewbody.h: Added test for resonance.  If retval.Nosc
	  >= 1, then it was a resonance.

2004-11-12 15:16  fregeau

	* Makefile, Makefile.osx, fewbody.h, scripts/post.sh: Minor changes
	  to reflect my new environment.

2004-03-05 11:53  fregeau

	* fewbody.h: Starting 0.22...

2004-03-05 11:36  fregeau

	* fewbody.h: Version bump to 0.21 (Bender).  This is mainly a bug
	  fix release, with no changes in the interface from the previous
	  version (0.20).  The bugs fixed do not change the physics.
	  However, the stability test for [[* *] [* *]] quadruples has
	  changed and is now the Mardling & Aarseth (2001) test, from
	  section 4.2 of their paper.

2004-03-05 11:32  fregeau

	* fewbody_hier.c: Changed from malloc() to calloc() in
	  fb_malloc_hier() to get rid of harmless Valgrind errors due to
	  normalizing uninitialized memory.

2004-03-05 11:22  fregeau

	* Makefile, scripts/post.sh, scripts/release.sh, scripts/setver.sh:
	  Updated for use with CVS.

2004-03-05 10:54  fregeau

	* TODO: Updated.

2004-03-05 10:51  fregeau

	* fewbody_classify.c: Added ad-hoc correction factor for the
	  stability of [[* *] [* *]] quadruples from section 4.2 of
	  Mardling & Aarseth (2001).

2004-03-05 08:40  fregeau

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: Rename.

2004-03-05 08:38  fregeau

	* README: Updated to reflect the fact that the stellar collisions
	  paper has been submitted to MNRAS and is on astro-ph.
