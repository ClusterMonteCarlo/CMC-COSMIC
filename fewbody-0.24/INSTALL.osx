To build Fewbody on Mac OS X, you need to have GCC, GSL, and GNU getopt 
installed.  GCC is included in the Apple development suite, which comes 
with OS X, and is therefore easy to install if it isn't already.  GSL 
and GNU getopt are easiest installed via Fink 
(http://fink.sourceforge.net).  Once you have Fink installed, install 
"gsl", "gsl-shlibs", and "libgnugetopt".  These will all be installed in 
"/sw".  Next, run "make" and "make install" to build and install Fewbody 
in the directory "bin" in your home directory.
